-- A very rudimentary collision system.
--
-- It compares every pair of objects, trying to determine if there is a
-- collision between the two of them.
--
-- NOTE: In order to minimize the number of comparisons, only moving objects
-- are tested (against every game object). That's only 2 objects right now
-- (making it almost linear in complexity), but it could easily grow and become
-- too slow.

-- HN 2014-09-07: New interface to collision detection.
--
-- The assumption is that collision detection happens globally and that the
-- changed velocity is figured out for each object involved in a collision
-- based on the properties of all objects involved in any specific interaction.
-- That may not be how it works now, but the interface means it could work that
-- way. Even more physical might be to figure out the impulsive force acting on
-- each object.
--
-- However, the whole collision infrastructure should be revisited.
--
-- - Statefulness ("edge") might make it more robust.
--
-- - Think through how collision events are going to be communicated to the
--   objects themselves. Maybe an input event is the natural thing to do.
--   Except then we have to be careful to avoid switching again immediately
--   after one switch.
--
-- - Should try to avoid n^2 checks. Maybe some kind of quad-trees?  Maybe
--   spawning a stateful collision detector when two objects are getting close?
--   Cf. the old tail-gating approach.
-- - Maybe a collision should also carry the identity of the object one
--   collieded with to facilitate impl. of "inCollisionWith".
